The project is split into two parts `SCM` and `shapley-flow`. 
Both parts need different environments. 
Hereby the code in the `SCM` folder should be executed first, as the file `01_get_data_nuc.ipynb` is used to create the datafile `data_selected_FR_2018-2023.csv`, which is also used by `shapley-flow`.

For more information about the `SCM` code please refer to the corresponding `README.md`.
